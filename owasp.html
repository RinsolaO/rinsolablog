          OWASP Top 10 - The Open Web Application Security Project, is an NGO
          aimed at improving the security of software applications. OWASP top 10
          is a standard awareness document for developers and web application
          security.

          <ul class="blog-paragraph">
            Owasp Top 10 Security Risk
            <li>
              Broken Access Control - May occur when access is breached by
              unauthorized users <br />
              Prevention <br />
              Except for public resources, deny by default. <br />
              Implement access control mechanisms once and re-use them
              throughout the application. <br />
              Log access control failures, alert admins when appropriate
            </li>
            <li>
              Cryptographic Failures - Occurs when sensitive date e.g credit
              cards, passwords are not properly encrypted.<br />

              Prevention<br />
              Don't store sensitive data unnecessarily. Make sure to encrypt all
              sensitive data at rest. <br />
              Disable caching for responses that contain sensitive data. <br />
              Apply required security controls as per the data classification.
            </li>
            <li>
              Injection - A vulnerability that allows attackers to get data in a
              malicious way from an app <br />

              Prevention<br />
              Use positive server-side input validation. <br />
              Use a safe API, which avoids using the interpreter entirely.
            </li>
            <li>
              Insecure Design - When Secure Development Life Cycle is not
              thoroughly followed in the development process, it may threaten
              the app’s security. <br />

              Prevention<br />
              Create and use a secure development lifecycle that obeys design
              security and privacy-related controls <br />
              Integrate security language and controls into user stories <br />
            </li>
            <li>
              Security Misconfiguration - The software may be vulnerable if
              unnecessary features are installed, software is out of date,
              misconfigured permission on cloud services<br />

              Prevention<br />
              Regular review to check and update configurations <br />
              Remove unused dependencies / unnecessary features
            </li>
            <li>
              Vulnerable And Outdated Components - A software may be vulnerable
              if software developers do not test it regularly, check the
              compatibility of updated or patched libraries <br />

              Prevention <br />
              Remove unused dependencies / unnecessary features <br />
              Only obtain components from official sources over secure links
            </li>
            <li>
              Identification And Authentication Failures - Occurs when there is
              an authentication weakness.<br />

              Prevention<br />
              Implement weak password checks, such as testing new or changed
              passwords against the top 10,000 worst passwords list.<br />
              Use a server-side, secure, built-in session manager that generates
              a new random session ID with high entropy after login. <br />
              Where possible, implement multi-factor authentication to prevent
              automated credential stuffing, brute force, and stolen credential
              reuse attacks.
            </li>

            <li>
              Software And Data Integrity Failures - This occurs when there is a
              breach in the integrity of software or data <br />
              Prevention<br />
              Use hashing / digital to protect software’s integrity<br />
              Ensure code is reviewed before deployment
            </li>
            <li>
              Security Logging And Monitoring Failures - Without logging and
              monitoring, breaches cannot be detected. Insufficient logging,
              detection, monitoring, and active response occurs any time: <br />
              Logs of applications and APIs are not monitored regularly <br />
              Logs are only stored locally <br />
              Prevention - Developes should ensure ; <br />
              Ensure that logs are generated in a format that log management
              solutions can easily consume. <br />
              Ensure log data is encoded correctly to prevent injections or
              attacks on the logging or monitoring systems.
            </li>

            <li>
              Server Side Request Forgery - this occurs whenever a web
              application is fetching a remote resource without validating the
              user-supplied URL. <br />

              Prevention <br />
              Ensure thorough validation before authentication <br />
              Do not send raw responses to clients <br />
              Disable HTTP redirections <br />
              Don't deploy other security relevant services on front systems
            </li>
