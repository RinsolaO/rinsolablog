          Access control is a fundamental component of data security that
          dictates who’s allowed to access and use company information and
          resources. Through authentication and authorization, access control
          policies make sure users are who they say they are and that they have
          appropriate access to company data. Access control can also be applied
          to limit physical access to campuses, buildings, rooms, and
          datacenters.

            Access Control Models
            <ul class="blog-list">
              <li>
                Discretionary access control (DAC): In this method, the owner or
                administrator of the protected system, data, or resource sets
                the policies for who is allowed access. It is a type of access
                control system that assigns access rights based on rules
                specified by users. The principle behind DAC is that subjects
                can determine who has access to their objects. The DAC model
                takes advantage of using access control lists (ACLs) and
                capability tables. Capability tables contain rows with ‘subject’
                and columns containing ‘object’. The security kernel within the
                operating system checks the tables to determine if access is
                allowed. Sometimes a subject/program may only have access to
                read a file; the security kernel makes sure no unauthorized
                changes occur.

                Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) –RBAC grants access based on
                defined business functions rather than the individual user’s
                identity. The goal is to provide users with access only to data
                that’s been deemed necessary for their roles within the
                organization. This widely used method is based on a complex
                combination of role assignments, authorizations, and
                permissions. It presents an opportunity for the organization to
                address the principle of ‘least privilege’. This gives an
                individual only the access needed to do their job, since access
                is connected to their job.

                Mandatory Access Control (MAC) –In this nondiscretionary model,
                people are granted access based on an information clearance. A
                central authority regulates access rights based on different
                security levels. This model is common in government and military
                environments. The design and implementation of MAC is commonly
                used by the government. It uses a hierarchical approach to
                control access to files/resources. Under a MAC environment,
                access to resource objects is controlled by the settings defined
                by a system administrator.
                <br /><br />
                This means access to resource objects is controlled by the
                operating system based on what the system administrator
                configured in the settings. It is not possible for users to
                change access control of a resource. MAC uses “security labels”
                to assign resource objects on a system. There are two pieces of
                information connected to these security labels: classification
                (high, medium, low) and category (specific department or project
                – provides “need to know”). Each user account is also assigned
                classification and category properties. This system provides
                users access to an object if both properties match. If a user
                has high classification but is not part of the category of the
                object, then the user cannot access the object. MAC is the most
                secure access control but requires a considerable amount of
                planning and requires a high system management due to the
                constant updating of objects and account labels. Considered the
                strictest of all levels of access control systems

                Attribute-based access control (ABAC): In this dynamic method,
                access is based on a set of attributes and environmental
                conditions, such as time of day and location, assigned to both
                users and resources.
