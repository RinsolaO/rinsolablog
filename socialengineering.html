          Social engineering is the term used for a broad range of malicious
          activities accomplished through human interactions. It uses
          psychological manipulation to trick users into making security
          mistakes or giving away sensitive information. <br />

          Social engineering attacks happen in one or more steps. A perpetrator
          first investigates the intended victim to gather necessary background
          information, such as potential points of entry and weak security
          protocols, needed to proceed with the attack. Then, the attacker moves
          to gain the victim’s trust and provide stimuli for subsequent actions
          that break security practices, such as revealing sensitive information
          or granting access to critical resources.

            <li>
              Baiting As its name implies, baiting attacks use a false promise
              to pique a victim’s greed or curiosity. They lure users into a
              trap that steals their personal information or inflicts their
              systems with malware.<br />

              The most reviled form of baiting uses physical media to disperse
              malware. For example, attackers leave the bait—typically
              malware-infected flash drives—in conspicuous areas where potential
              victims are certain to see them (e.g., bathrooms, elevators, the
              parking lot of a targeted company). The bait has an authentic look
              to it, such as a label presenting it as the company’s payroll
              list.<br />

              Victims pick up the bait out of curiosity and insert it into a
              work or home computer, resulting in automatic malware installation
              on the system.<br />

              Baiting scams don’t necessarily have to be carried out in the
              physical world. Online forms of baiting consist of enticing ads
              that lead to malicious sites or that encourage users to download a
              malware-infected application.<br />

              Scareware involves victims being bombarded with false alarms and
              fictitious threats. Users are deceived to think their system is
              infected with malware, prompting them to install software that has
              no real benefit (other than for the perpetrator) or is malware
              itself. Scareware is also referred to as deception software, rogue
              scanner software and fraudware.<br />

              Prevention<br />
              Multifactor authentication is one way to mitigate broken
              authentication.

            <li>
              Scareware - Scareware involves victims being bombarded with false
              alarms and fictitious threats. Users are deceived to think their
              system is infected with malware, prompting them to install
              software that has no real benefit (other than for the perpetrator)
              or is malware itself. Scareware is also referred to as deception
              software, rogue scanner software and fraudware. <br />

              A common scareware example is the legitimate-looking popup banners
              appearing in your browser while surfing the web, displaying such
              text such as, “Your computer may be infected with harmful spyware
              programs.” It either offers to install the tool (often
              malware-infected) for you, or will direct you to a malicious site
              where your computer becomes infected.<br />

              Scareware is also distributed via spam email that doles out bogus
              warnings, or makes offers for users to buy worthless/harmful
              services.

            <li>
              Pretexting- Here an attacker obtains information through a series
              of cleverly crafted lies. The scam is often initiated by a
              perpetrator pretending to need sensitive information from a victim
              so as to perform a critical task. <br />

              The attacker usually starts by establishing trust with their
              victim by impersonating co-workers, police, bank and tax
              officials, or other persons who have right-to-know authority. The
              pretexter asks questions that are ostensibly required to confirm
              the victim’s identity, through which they gather important
              personal data.<br />
              All sorts of pertinent information and records is gathered using
              this scam, such as social security numbers, personal addresses and
              phone numbers, phone records, staff vacation dates, bank records
              and even security information related to a physical plant. <br />
            </li>
            <li>
              Phishing - As one of the most popular social engineering attack
              types, phishing scams are email and text message campaigns aimed
              at creating a sense of urgency, curiosity or fear in victims. It
              then prods them into revealing sensitive information, clicking on
              links to malicious websites, or opening attachments that contain
              malware.<br />

              An example is an email sent to users of an online service that
              alerts them of a policy violation requiring immediate action on
              their part, such as a required password change. It includes a link
              to an illegitimate website—nearly identical in appearance to its
              legitimate version—prompting the unsuspecting user to enter their
              current credentials and new password. Upon form submittal the
              information is sent to the attacker.<br />
            </li>

            <li>
              Spear phishing - This is a more targeted version of the phishing
              scam whereby an attacker chooses specific individuals or
              enterprises. They then tailor their messages based on
              characteristics, job positions, and contacts belonging to their
              victims to make their attack less conspicuous. Spear phishing
              requires much more effort on behalf of the perpetrator and may
              take weeks and months to pull off. They’re much harder to detect
              and have better success rates if done skillfully.<br />

              A spear phishing scenario might involve an attacker who, in
              impersonating an organization’s IT consultant, sends an email to
              one or more employees. It’s worded and signed exactly as the
              consultant normally does, thereby deceiving recipients into
              thinking it’s an authentic message. The message prompts recipients
              to change their password and provides them with a link that
              redirects them to a malicious page where the attacker now captures
              their credentials. <br />
